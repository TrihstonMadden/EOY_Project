DOCUMENTATION of my EOY project
by Trihston Madden

My goal is to config this camera, and have it send images every minute to a ftp server i set up, and have it list the date when it came into it.

steps i took

1.take camera down
2. plug ethernet cable from pc to injector
3. plug ethernet from injector to camera
4. press and hold black button on the camera while power to camera is unplug then plug in power and keep holding button for longer than 10 secs
5. change the ip by ifconfig eno1 “the ip” netmask “netmask”
6. ping 192.168.1.64
7.web browser go to 192.168.1.64
8. change ip on camera to 10.183.100.2 netmask 255.255.0.0
9. set gateway to 10.183.0.1
10. set dns server to 10.40.0.14
11. ftp in advance setting
12. server address 10.183.2.21
13.become su
14. systemctl start vsftpd
15. ftp 10.183.2.21
16. type in username and password
17. Set directory structure to save in parent directory
18. Set parent directory to custom and name of folder in mine “cam”
19. Set for 30 days picture name
20. Check upload picture
21. Save
22. Go to storage>schedule settings>capture> capture parameters
23. Set format to jpeg> 1 min
24. Check enable event-triggered snapshot box
25. Format jpeg> 60 s capture number 1

The break through that i had was when i figured out the parent guide.(the parent guide is what folder it sends the images too.)
